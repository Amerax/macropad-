# EZpad

A compact productivity macropad built around the Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040. The project includes a custom PCB designed in KiCad and QMK firmware, with 6 keys and a rotary encoder for everyday shortcuts like copy, paste, plus volume control and an OLED status display.

Features:
5 push-button keys + 1 rotary encoder with integrated push switch (6 keys total), wired direct-pin (no matrix). Not having matrix makes it much simpler and easy. 
Rotary encoder controls system volume 
0.91" I2C OLED display (SSD1306-compatible) for status.
Firmware built on QMK, running on a Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040.
Firmware is custom made persoanlly built. 

Schematic
The KiCad schematic shows the XIAO RP2040 connected directly to five push buttons and a rotary encoder using GPIO pins, plus an I2C-connected OLED display.
I made this all myself for the first time ever,
My very own first schema

PCB
Same to be said about the pcb. It is quite simple enough, not as many traces as a motherboard haha.

Cad
I used a bit of both onshape and fusion360. But here is image from onsahpe.
